**Find a Course**
Find a Course is a web app that lets you find the ideal online or classroom-based course for you. Users can search for a course, view availability and register on the course if there are places available. They can also deregister from a course if they change their mind. Logging in is mocked by using state in App.js - if you would like to change the user to yourself, simply edit the name here.

**Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**Installation Instructions**
You will need to install Node.js at version10.15.3 on your local machine to run Find a Course.

**Node**
Type the command below to check whether you already have node installed:

$ node -v

If node is already installed, the output of the command will display the version (e.g. v10.15.3). If you need to install node, please follow this link (http://nodejs.org/en/). If you are working on a Mac, it is recommended to do this using homebrew(https://changelog.com/posts/install-node-js-with-homebrew-on-os-x)

**React**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can install React globally on your computer by typing:
